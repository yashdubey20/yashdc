/*

Looking at the output, we can see that the initial clock values of all nodes are the same because they were initialized with the current time in seconds, and they were created almost simultaneously. After synchronization, the clocks of all nodes have been adjusted to be closer to the time server's clock. Node 1's clock has been adjusted by -10 seconds, Node 2's clock has been adjusted by +5 seconds, and Node 3's clock has been adjusted by -20 seconds, which corresponds to their respective initial offsets from the time server's clock.

Overall, the algorithm aims to synchronize all the nodes' clocks with the time server's clock, even if they are running on different machines and have different initial offsets from real-time.
